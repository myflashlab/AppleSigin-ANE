# Apple sign in ANE
Apple sign in ANE for AdobeAIR is a must have ANE if you are already using other Authentication ANEs like Facebook or GoogleSignIn. This ANE makes it easy for your users to sign in to your app using their Apple ID.

**Main Features:**
* Works on iOS 13+ but it won't crash on earlier iOS versions

```actionscript
import com.myflashlab.air.extensions.appleSignIn.*;

AppleSignIn.init();

AppleSignIn.listener.addEventListener(AppleSignInEvent.SUCCESS, onSuccess);
AppleSignIn.listener.addEventListener(AppleSignInEvent.FAILURE, onFailure);

AppleSignIn.authorize();

function onSuccess(event:AppleSignInEvent):void {
    trace("onSuccess: " + JSON.stringify(event.result));
}

            break;
        case AppleSignInEvent.ERROR_FAILED:
